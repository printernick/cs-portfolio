# cs-portfolio
Website displaying my background and projects. I created it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had a responsive design so it was presentable in mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

A slightly outdated version can be viewed here: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~phikhant/. Cannot be updated because I no longer have access to my university's server that is hosting it.
